Welcome to Scenic Route!

You'll be started building
tracks in no time.
In each level, you must build
the longest track you can.
Our passengers want to see
all the island has to offer!
Use the left mouse button to
draw tracks.
The right mouse button erases
tracks if you make a mistake.
Draw a track along the island
to connect the stations.
