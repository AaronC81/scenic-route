# Scenic Route
Scenic Route is a track-building puzzle game. Read more [here](https://orangeflash81.itch.io/scenic-route)!

## Building
You'll need the Ruby interpreter (if you don't already have it) and a few Ruby packages (called gems).
Assuming you're on Ubuntu, run these commands in your terminal:

```
apt install ruby-full
gem install gosu
gem install Platform
```

(If you're comfortable with Ruby, there's a Gemfile so you can use Bundler for dependencies.)

To actually run the game:

```
ruby src/scenic_route.rb
```
